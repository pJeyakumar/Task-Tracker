# Message to WAI Team
This website is just something very temporary, it's main purpose is to show you guys how a simple React App looks like, it makes use of components, functions, CSS styling, and HTML.

I commented the less intuitive parts to help create a better understanding of what's going on, what each function is doing, and what's being displayed. If there are any parts you are confused about, please let me know!

Sorry I couldn't make it to today's meeting :(
